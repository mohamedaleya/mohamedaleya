# Hi, I'm Mohamed 👋

Full Stack Engineer | UI/UX | Cloud Delivery  

I’m a Full Stack Engineer with 5 years of experience building web applications and data-driven dashboards across insurance, aerospace, IoT, and e-commerce. I’m strongest in **TypeScript, React, and Next.js**, with solid backend experience in **Node.js**, plus UI/UX fluency (Figma). I care a lot about reliability, performance, and maintainable architecture.

- Design and maintain APIs with validation, RBAC, and audit-friendly logging
- Improve production reliability with tests, structured logging, monitoring, and alerts
- Optimize performance with caching (Redis), query tuning, and payload reduction
- Prototype practical AI features (semantic search, retrieval, assistant workflows) with safe patterns and human review
